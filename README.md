## Description

A collaborative effort to create a site that features in-browser games made using JavaScript and APIâ€™s. Anyone can visit the site and play any of the games listed, and have their final scores saved. Scores are saved to localStorage and can be viewed by clicking the Leaderboards button on the main page. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updating HTML and CSS.

The HTML uses classes from Bootstrap to help with styling, but most importantly creates easily responsive components. As a result, there are fewer media queries needed which really helped speed up development.

User can click on any of the large game buttons and be redirected to a new page where the game and countdown begins.

A Music component also exists to allow the playing of an mp3 file. Initially meant to link up to the Spotify API and play sounds from there, but will need to become a future feature. Instead, a user can input the name of an artist and Spotify is queried to view the top 10 tracks from that artist, all viewable within a modal.

## Games side

Page currently features three games; Rock Paper Scissors, Whack-a-Mole, and Minesweeper.

### Rock Paper Scissors

### Minesweeper

![minesweeper game](./Assets/images/minesweeper-page.JPG)
A classic puzzle game from the past, re-created here. An API is used to create a 10x10 grid with predetermined lines containing numbers pertaining to the location of the mines. User clicks on a square to reveal what's underneath. Keep going until time runs out, or you hit a mine.

## Music/Spotify side

![music player](./Assets/images/audio-player.JPG)
A simple audio player is featured to allow the user to play some video game music while they play their mini games. The player has buttons to start, pause and stop the audio file from playing.

![spotify modal](./Assets/images/music-modal.JPG)
After a user inputs an artist name and hits the submit button, Spotify API is queried and generates the top 10 tracks relating to the specified artist. In the example above, "Kanye" was the string entered and it listed the top 10 tracks relating to him.
